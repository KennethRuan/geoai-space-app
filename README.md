### Mapping Data for Societal Benefit

We built a powerful compositing tool specifically designed to generate AI training datasets from meshes of publicly available data, making it the ideal aide for AI researchers and analysts. 

We strove to make the design intuitive for just about anyone to use, improving the accessibility of the data for the general population while still being capable of powering modern-day research.

An ambitious future for both civilian science as well as academic research lies ahead for DataBuilder and the OpenAI community.

### The Goal

The goal is that DataBuilder will be an intuitive resource for users to preview datasets and will act as a helpful building block for researchers. We hope the app will inspire others to play around with the vast and interesting world of geospatial data!
